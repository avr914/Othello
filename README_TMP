Hi!

This is the temporary readme file as I continue to set up my project and organize it into a git repository. As you can see right now, it's not very user-friendly to see. 

Some key points:
-If you're interested in learning what my project is all about, check out 'Leap_Final_proj.pdf'.
-If you're interested in learning about how I created this program, and the fundamental concepts behind it, check out 'Othello Player Final Version', my formal paper on my project that was published by IEEE at the ISEC 2015 conference for STEM education.
-The core files that control the logic can all be found in the 'java' directory.
	-The main files are the AI file, 'MyPlayerAlt.java' as well as the 'TestGame.java' runner file, and the 'OthelloBoard.java' and 'OptimizedOthelloBoard.java' files.

Contact:
-If you have any questions, comments, concerns, you can email me at arvindvjkumar@gmail.com.

Closing point:
-So that's about it guys. It's not very organized right now as you can see, but I'm working on that, and hopefully soon, there will be documentation available, as well as a much nicer organization scheme than the current one (chaos). This project was done while I was a junior in high school before I learned the important idea that other people might want to look at my code.

Enjoy!
